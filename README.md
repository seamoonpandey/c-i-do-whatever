# Why IDK?

This is some basic projects built using the beauty of the C programming, few console based games that I built under 2 hours when I was bored and just teting out vim, btw vim was fun to learn.  
It started with just a hello world c program to ludo to arena then saapsidi for more fun, fully automated and some beginner stuff.
